# NextAuth Session Undefined in API Route

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using NextAuth.js with API routes: the session object being undefined even after successful authentication.

## Problem

The API route attempts to access the session using `unstable_getServerSession`, but the session consistently remains undefined, despite successful login.  This is usually due to incorrect configuration or improper usage of the NextAuth session management within API routes.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that `unstable_getServerSession` is correctly imported and used within the API route.  It also requires ensuring the NextAuth configuration is correctly set up and the API route is properly protected.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Try to access the API route.  You'll likely observe an error indicating an undefined session.

## How to Fix

Refer to the `bugSolution.js` file for a corrected implementation, addressing the specific problem outlined in the `bug.js` file. The fix typically involves verifying the correct usage of `unstable_getServerSession` and the configuration of your NextAuth setup.
